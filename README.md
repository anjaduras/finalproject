##### HOW IT ALL STARTED:

- 3rd of June: first Figma project design, 
no pictures, 
no functionality, 
light theme only, 
the dictionary page concept is still in development

- 9th of June: added dark theme and from now on referring to the final.pdf

- 16th of June: LOTS of progress today! Finally created the REACT multipage project and put all the basic needed data there. for now theres no stzles at all exept font and text align. I also created an additional css file for all of the pages. Ozama said it would be cool if there also was an about-me page so Im planning to do it later today. He also approved the idea and said its really cool! Im happy xp
