##### HOW IT ALL STARTED:

- 3rd of June: first Figma project design, 
no pictures, 
no functionality, 
light theme only, 
the dictionary page concept is still in development

- 9th of June: added dark theme and from now on referring to the final.pdf

- 16th of June: Great news! Today marked significant progress in the development of my project. I successfully set up the project structure and included almost all the essential components and data needed for functionality. While the visual styling is currently minimal, with only basic font selection and text alignment, I plan to enhance the aesthetics in the upcoming stages. Rest assured, the project will soon be visually captivating and polished.
  
In response to input from Ozama, I decided to incorporate an "About Me" page into the project. And in general, Ozama was thrilled with the idea and expressed full support for it! I'm really happy xp

Exciting times lie ahead!

- 20th of June: A lot of things today! I successfully added a YouTube API to my "NjuraCourse" page. The thing is the background pictures are horrifyingly bad. I dont really know how to fix it yet:( I also made the "Game" page a bit functional - the random gestures are generated, but I did nothing with buttons so far.
  
- 21st of June: I mostly worked on Dictionary page today. Now the alphabet part is all done and looking really pretty. Still need no add GIFs for greetings and colours. I also provided all of the needed info for International page- 5 websites with link and explanation.

- 22nd of June: planning to work on Game today.
